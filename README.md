# Idea
During group coding sessions, whether it be in an interview or at school/work, we always speak out our ideas in code. However, in conversation, it is difficult to keep track of the code simply by listening to one speak out their ideas. Having the ability to visually see the code from audio would greatly aid in communicating between colleagues, employers or classmates.

We intentionally did not want to "proof-read" the code as it is written, as we felt it may be too overbearing and a bit unnecessary for the ideal user.
